# Ace [Serve]

Use Ace to serve up static files.

## Install
`go install github.com/samuelcouch/ace`

## Usage
From the directory where you want to serve up files from simply call
`ace`

Ace defaults to port 3000, if you want to specify the port yourself, use the `-p` flag. If you would like to specify a directory to serve, use the `-d` flag, otherwise Ace will default to the current directory.
